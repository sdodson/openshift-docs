== Overview
To upgrade your OpenShift cluster without disruption, it is important to upgrade
components as documented in this topic. Before you begin your upgrade,
familiarize yourself with the entire procedure.
link:#additional-instructions-per-release[Specific releases] may require
additional steps to be performed at key points during the standard upgrade
process.

Unless noted otherwise, node and masters within a major version are forward and
backward compatible, so upgrading your cluster should go smoothly. However, you
should not run mismatched versions longer than necessary to upgrade the entire
cluster.

[NOTE]
====
This topic pertains to RPM-based installations (i.e., the
link:install/quick_install.html[quick] and
link:install/advanced_install.html[advanced installation] methods) only and does
not currently cover container-based installations.
====

[[upgrading-masters]]

== Upgrading Masters
Upgrade your masters first. On each master host, upgrade the *openshift-master*
package:

----
# yum upgrade openshift-master
----

Then, restart the *openshift-master* service and review its logs to ensure
services have been restarted successfully:

----
# systemctl restart openshift-master
# journalctl -r -u openshift-master
----

[[upgrading-policy-definitions]]

== Updating Policy Definitions
After a cluster upgrade, the recommended
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[default
cluster roles] may have been updated. To check if an update is recommended for
your environment, you can run:

----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles
----

This command outputs a list of roles that are out of date and their new proposed
values. For example:

====
----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ClusterRole
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: null
    name: admin
  rules:
  - attributeRestrictions: null
    resources:
    - builds/custom
...
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Your output will vary based on the OpenShift version and any local
customizations you have made. Review the proposed policy carefully.
====

You can either modify this output to re-apply any local policy changes you have
made, or you can automatically apply the new policy by running:

----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles --confirm
----

[[upgrading-nodes]]

== Upgrading Nodes
After upgrading your masters, you can upgrade your nodes. When restarting the
*openshift-node* service, there will be a brief disruption of outbound network
connectivity from running pods to services while the
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#service-proxy[service
proxy] is restarted. The length of this disruption should be very short and
scales based on the number of services in the entire cluster.

On each node host, upgrade all *openshift* packages:

----
yum upgrade openshift\*
----

Then, restart the *openshift-node* service:

----
systemctl restart openshift-node
----

As a user with *cluster-admin* privileges, verify that all nodes are showing as
*Ready*:

====
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                    LABELS                                        STATUS
master.example.com      kubernetes.io/hostname=master.example.com     Ready,SchedulingDisabled
node1.example.com       kubernetes.io/hostname=node1.example.com      Ready
node2.example.com       kubernetes.io/hostname=node2.example.com      Ready
----

[[upgrading-the-router]]

== Upgrading the Router
If you have previously link:install/deploy_router.html[deployed a router], the
router deployment configuration must be upgraded to apply updates contained in
the router image.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To upgrade your router without disrupting services, you must have previously
deployed a
link:high_availability.html#configuring-a-highly-available-routing-service[highly-available
routing service].
====

Edit your router's deployment configuration. For example, if it has the default
*router* name:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

If necessary, adjust the `*rollingParams*` parameter so that it is set to
*down-then-up* to allow rolling upgrades. This is necessary if the replica count
is equal to the number of nodes that match the selector for your router; for
example, if `*replicas: 2*` and you have specified `zone=infra` with only two
nodes that match that value.

TODO

Need to update this after https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/3701 merges.

====
----
..
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    router: router
  strategy:
    resources: {}
    rollingParams:
      intervalSeconds: 1
      timeoutSeconds: 120
      updatePeriodSeconds: 1
    type: Rolling
..
----
====

Update the image version to match the version you are upgrading to, for example
*v3.0.1.0*:

====
----
image: openshift3/ose-haproxy-router:v3.0.1.0
imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
----
====

You should see one router pod updated and then the next.

[[upgrading-the-registry]]

== Upgrading the Registry
The registry must also be upgraded for changes to take effect in the registry
image. If you have used a `*PersistentVolumeClaim*` or a host mount point, you
may restart the registry without losing the contents of your registry. The
link:install/docker_registry.html#storage-for-the-registry[registry
installation] topic details how to configure persistent storage.

Edit your registry's deployment configuration:

----
oc edit dc/docker-registry
----

Update the image version to match the version you are upgrading to, for example
*v3.0.1.0*:

====
----
image: openshift3/ose-docker-registry:v3.0.1.0
imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Images that are being pushed or pulled from the internal registry at the time of
upgrade will fail and should be restarted automatically. This will not disrupt
pods that are already running.
====

[[updating-the-default-image-streams]]

== Updating the Default Image Streams
You may also wish to ensure that your database and S2I ImageStreams are updated.
For each image stream in the default *openshift* project, you can run:

----
# oc image-import -n openshift <imagestream>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
This will trigger a rebuild of all images built from these image streams if
their build configurations have the
link:../dev_guide/builds.html#image-change-triggers[`*ImageChange*` trigger]
configured to do so. Before running `oc image-import`, ensure that all pods that
persist data have properly configured persistent volumes. Pods with replica
count greater than one will be updated in a rolling manner.
====

For example, get the list of all image streams in the default *openshift*
project:

====
----
# oc get is -n openshift

====

Update each image stream one at a time:

====
----
# oc import-image -n openshift nodejs
Waiting for the import to complete, CTRL+C to stop waiting.
The import completed successfully.

[[additional-instructions-per-release]]

== Additional Instructions per Release

Some OpenShift releases may have additional instructions specific to that
release that must be performed to fully apply the updates across the cluster.
Read through the following sections carefully depending on your upgrade path, as
you may be required to perform certain steps and key points during the standard
upgrade process described earlier in this topic.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
=== OpenShift Enterprise 3.0.0.0 to 3.0.1.0

*Creating a Service Account for the Router*

The router was updated to utilize host ports in OpenShift Enterprise 3.0.1.0 and
requires that a service account be created and made a member of the privileged
link:manage_scc.html[security context constraint] (SCC).

After upgrading your master and nodes but before updating to the newer router,
you must create a service account for the router. As a cluster administrator,
ensure you are operating on the *default* project:

====
----
# oc project default
====

Delete any existing *router* service account and create a new one:

====
----
# oc delete serviceaccount/router
serviceaccounts/router

# echo '{"kind":"ServiceAccount","apiVersion":"v1","metadata":{"name":"router"}}' | oc create -f -
serviceaccounts/router
----
====

Edit the *privileged* SCC:

====
----
# oc edit scc privileged
----
====

Add the service account you created to the users list at the end of the file,
then save the changes:

====
----
users:
- system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:build-controller
- system:serviceaccount:default:router
----
====

Edit your router's deployment configuration:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
        - containerPort: 1936
          hostPort: 1936
          name: stats
          protocol: TCP
        resources: {}
        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      serviceAccount: router
      serviceAccountName: router
...
----
====

Now upgrade your router per the link:#upgrading-the-router[standard router
upgrade steps].
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
=== OpenShift Origin 1.0.3 to 1.0.4

*Creating a Service Account for the Router*

The router was updated to utilize host ports in OpenShift Origin 1.0.4 and
requires that a service account be created and made a member of the privileged
link:manage_scc.html[security context constraint] (SCC).

After upgrading your master and nodes but before updating to the newer router,
you must create a service account for the router. As a cluster administrator,
ensure you are operating on the *default* project:

====
----
# oc project default
----
====

Delete any existing *router* service account and create a new one:

====
----
# oc delete serviceaccount/router
serviceaccounts/router

# echo '{"kind":"ServiceAccount","apiVersion":"v1","metadata":{"name":"router"}}' | oc create -f -
serviceaccounts/router
----
====

Edit the *privileged* SCC:

====
----
# oc edit scc privileged
----
====

Add the service account you created to the users list at the end of the file,
then save the changes:

====
----
users:
- system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:build-controller
- system:serviceaccount:default:router
----
====

Edit your router's deployment configuration:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
        - containerPort: 1936
          hostPort: 1936
          name: stats
          protocol: TCP
        resources: {}
        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      serviceAccount: router
      serviceAccountName: router
...
----
====

Now upgrade your router per the link:#upgrading-the-router[standard router
upgrade steps].
endif::[]

== TODO
* Once the installer allows you to add nodes, document adding additional capacity
then tearing down old nodes rather than upgrading nodes in place.
* Quantify the impact of kube proxy restarts on a moderately sized node, how
long are services busted, what happens etc.
